### What is capsicum?

Capsicum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family *Solanaceae*. Native to the Americas for thousands of years, Capsicum species are now cultivated worldwide, used in food, medicine, and in lachrymatory agents like sleeping gas, riot control, and mace.

My father taught me to have a sense of humor about experimentation and failure. I do a lot of both. That's why this journal is called Capsicum. Programming is hard.

### About me

I'm a data scientist, Python programmer, and author who lives in Washington, DC. If I'm not at work or here, I'm either cooking, practicing ukulele, or riding bikes with my family.
